## Start
- Change mpg123 to afplay
- Download each episode to the temp dir before playing them

## Additional
- Inform the user that the episode is downloading since it won't start playing immediately (which it does with mpg123)
- Make the player quite exept during startup. Add option -v for some console logging.
